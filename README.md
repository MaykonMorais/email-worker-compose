* **Database**: Postgres - used for just to store simple messages.
* **Workers**: Used for capture messages from service queue and send them.

## Instalation ðŸ”§

First of all make sure you have installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) on your machine.

After that, create a copy from file **env.example** and rename them to **.env**:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Obs: Just remember to define a value to DB_PASSWORD.

Finally just build all containers and be happy! 
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Workers :zap:

We can run multiples instances of workers on demand for messaging. To define the numbers of workers use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --scale worker=<number_of_instances>
```
